# Choosy

## The what?

Choosy is an application, that allows you to select what links should be opened in which browser.

## Why?

I use different browsers for different purpose. I use Firefox as browser for work, and Safari for personal stuff.
When somebody send me the link to Jira or Confluence or pull request for the working project i want this page to be opened in Firefox, not in safari.

Choosy acts as default browser, where you can make custom rules, that will be used to figure out what browser should be used.
